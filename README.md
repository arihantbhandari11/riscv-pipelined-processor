## RISC-V Pipelined Processor
This is a Verilog implementation of a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor based on the RV32I instruction set architecture. It supports key instructions including arithmetic, load/store, branch, and jump. The pipeline structure improves performance by overlapping instruction execution.


## ðŸš€ Features

- RV32I instruction support
- 5-stage pipeline: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback
- Hazard detection and forwarding logic
- ALU with support for add, sub, and/or/xor/slt
- Testbench for simulation and verification
