## RISC-V Pipelined Processor
This is a Verilog implementation of a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor based on the RV32I instruction set architecture. It supports key instructions including arithmetic, load/store, branch, and jump. The pipeline structure improves performance by overlapping instruction execution.
